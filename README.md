Key Insights

ðŸ’¡ Subscription Types

The Basic plan is the most popular, but there is a fairly even distribution across all plans.

Netflix may explore strategies to upsell Basic users to higher-tier plans.

Premium subscriptions are highest in Spain, while Standard plans dominate in the UK.

ðŸ’¡ Subscription Duration

Netflix retains most users for nearly a year.

Some users cancel within 1â€“2 months, indicating a need for better engagement strategies.

Long-term subscribers (>1 year) are fewer, highlighting retention challenges beyond the first year.

Analyzing short-term cancellations can help improve retention strategies.

ðŸ’¡ Gender & Age Distribution

Gender distribution is nearly equal in Netflixâ€™s user base.

Most users are in their late 30s to early 40s, suggesting an opportunity for tailored content.

ðŸ’¡ Lifetime Value (LTV)

The U.S. and Spain contribute the highest total LTV, meaning a large portion of Netflix's revenue comes from these users.

France and the UK have the highest Average LTV, driven by higher-tier subscriptions and strong retention.

Italy has the lowest revenue, with most users on the Basic plan, indicating a potential churn issue.

Conclusion

Netflix retains most users for nearly a year, but early cancellations (1â€“2 months) highlight an opportunity for improved engagement. While the Basic plan is most popular, Premium and Standard plans drive higher revenue, particularly in France and the UK. From an LTV perspective, the U.S. and Spain generate the highest total revenue, while France and the UK lead in Average LTV due to their strong adoption of higher-tier plans. Italy presents a churn risk due to a high proportion of Basic users.
